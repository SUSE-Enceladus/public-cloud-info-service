%description
Customers may have their networks configured such that outgoing connections are
not possible. However, they do want to allow access to our update servers.
Therefore, customers are interested to get the IP addresses of our
infrastructure servers to allow traffic to those systems.

publicCloudInfo provides a RESTful API, returning JSON and XML data, about
infrastructure servers in the public cloud, and the status of images published
in the public cloud, including deprecation status.
